- 👋 Hi, I’m @joelsb I'm so new on the Github universe as a new seed that reaches the ground, 
- so I'm just waiting for the sun and rain that comes to make me tough for the world I'm going to face, 
- even if it costs the seed some pain, I'm willing to get  through all that just to make my purpose true to myself and the ones near me.
-
- 👀 I’m interested in IoT and some Internet Stuff.
- 🌱 I’m currently studing Computer Engineering
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any Internet of Things company and also any Internet Services Provider
- 📫 How to reach me (joelsb2001@gmail.com) right now I'm not on many social Media :(
